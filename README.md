# Investigate-a-Dataset-using-Python-libraries
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis.

The dataset I've selected for analysis contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
I analyzed this data set to answer 2 questions:
     1) Which movies generally make the highest Revenue? 
     2) Which genres are most popular from year to year?

In Data Wrangling section of the project, I loaded in the data, checked for cleanliness, and then trimmed and cleaned the dataset for analysis.

In Exploratory Data Analysis section of the project, I used the libraries built in functions to describe the data and to visualize it, finally I summarized my findings and conclusions.
